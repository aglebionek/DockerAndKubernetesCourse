## Docker and Kubernetes: The Complete Guide
A repository for the course [Docker and Kubernetes: The Complete Guide](https://www.udemy.com/course/docker-and-kubernetes-the-complete-guide/) on Udemy.
The course is taught by Stephen Grider.

### Repo explanation (update 07-Oct-2024)
This repository was started a long time ago, when I first started this course. I only finished the Docker part of the course, which was extremely helpful. Now, years later, I'm going to finish the course, for both the Kubernetes and AWS parts.

The _OLD_ directory contains all the code I made when I first started the course. Eveyrthing else is new and will follow the structure of the course, unlike the old sections.
